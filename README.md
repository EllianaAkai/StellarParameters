# StellarParameters
This is a program that allows you to predict stellar parameters (mass, age, hydrogen abundance X, heavy element abundance Z, mixing length parameter MLT, and radius) with input parameters of temperature, metallicity [Fe/H], frequency at maximum power numax, large frequency separation Delta_nu, and luminosity.

## Instructions

- fast-histogram
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- pytorch
